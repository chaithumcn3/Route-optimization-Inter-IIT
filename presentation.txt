outline:
1. Describe the problem:
    a. normal explanation of problem.
    b. constraints and their priorities.
    c. impact of this problem in real time, eg. millions of dollars can
        be saved by having efficient soln.
Garbage Truck Scheduling
Reduces Carbon footprint
this problem impacts areas such as these

    d. the general methods of solving this; eg. linear programming and
        heuristic approaches in it, ant colonization and why these fail.

2. Our Solution

    Make a flowchart of the process

    a. Use TSP as we want to minimise cost eventually(explain TSP too).
    b. Problem in using TSP though, is its bad time complexity.
    c. Hence use clustering to improve time; explain the derivation
    d. This serves another purpose as well i.e bus size and percent occupancy,
        how: assign 1 bus for each cluster and run TSP for that cluster
    e. Now we have to make sure size of each cluster is >85% of bus cap
        and number of clusters is <= total number of buses available,
        to handle this, explain the process given by Chaithanya.(60%, 120%)

    f. We use KMeans algo for clustering, use the longitude and latitude
        data to make a 2d plot of the bus stops and their group decided
        by the algo.(also explain the number of clusters decided)
    g. To handle time window, run TSP on weighted graph, alpha beta
        method and plot a graph to find alpha such that time is within
        limit.
    h. Quantum approach - Chaithanya
